        <h2>We are Hiring!</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 40px; ">
            We are seeking Canadian videogame developers and designers in various disciplines.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; "><b>How to Apply?</b></p>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; ">
            Send an email to studio@michaeljared.ca with a <b>link to your portfolio</b>, and <b>your resume attached</b>.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; ">Use the subject line: <b>[Role Title] Application</b></p>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 40px; ">
            <b>All positions require a minimum of 1-2 years experience working in the games industry in some capacity.</b>
        </p>

        <h3 id="narrative-writer"><a href="#narrative-writer">Narrative Writer</a></h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; ">
            We are looking for a Narrative Writer to help bring emotional depth to the story of <em>Bushcraft Survival</em>. The Story Mode
            will not be released until the full launch of the game (late 2026), so there will be time to craft the narrative along with the art
            direction.
            The world and overarching themes center on solitude, the weight of leaving everything behind, and the search
            for peace and meaning in the wilderness.
            
            Your role will be to craft grounded, immersive narrative elements that support and deepen the emotional tone of the game,
            without filling in every possible detail.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; "><b>Responsibilities:</b></p>
        <ul class="bullet-list" style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: normal; ">
            <li>Write in-world notes, journals, and narrative artifacts that reflect the game's themes of solitude and self-discovery</li>
            <li>Write the core narrative arc of Bushcraft Survival's "Story Mode"</li>
            <li>Work with 3D/VFX artist and UI designer to help shape environmental storytelling opportunities</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; "><b>Requirements:</b></p>
        <ul class="bullet-list" style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: normal; ">
            <li>A portfolio showcasing emotionally resonant writing and narrative design for interactive media</li>
            <li>Strong instincts for minimalism, tone, pacing, and integrating story with other aspects of a videogame (environment, UI, game mechanics)</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 40px; font-style: italic; ">
            These roles are currently being hired in advance of confirmed funding. A <b>Letter of Intent</b> will be signed by both 
            parties for peace of mind.
            Contract offers are conditional upon the studio's successful funding application, with work expected to begin in October 2025.
