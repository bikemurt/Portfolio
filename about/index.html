        <h2>About</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 40px; ">

        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 40px; ">Videogame Development</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; ">
            The owner of the company, Michael Burt, is currently developing a passion project called "Bushcraft Survival". The project is 
            a return to his roots; growing up in Newfoundland and spending time in the bush hunting, trapping, and exploring.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; ">
            The studio focuses on <b>data driven</b> and <b>community focused</b> development. This means executing projects highly iteratively,
            and gaining feedback from players and playtesters as early and often as possible.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; ">
            Bushcraft Survival has validated the niche market it is targeting by looking at a number of metrics such as: median play time,
            total unique play tester counts, active daily users, as well as in-game retention metrics.
